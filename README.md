# evens_solver
A Python program to solve a puzzle

# Evens is a puzzle published in the Telegraph newspaper.
# A 4x4 grid is presented with each row and column having a total number
# Each cell in the grid is either an even or an odd number (indicated by shading - shaded cell = even number)
# The user must fill in the grid with numbers 1 - 9 , so that the rows and columns add up to the total.
# Each number may only be used once in a row/column.

# This program asks the user to enter a copy of a puzzle and then provides the solution.

# Create grid and ask user to input a puzzle (even/odd cells, row and column totals). Display grid to user for checking.
